#' Persistent homology is usually encoded as birth--death pairs (barcodes or
#' diagrams), but the space of persistence data sets does not satisfy convenient
#' statistical properties. Such applications as hypothesis testing and machine
#' learning benefit from transformations of persistence data, often to Hilbert
#' spaces (vector spaces with inner products and induced metrics).
